/**
 * Suppose our movie details documents are structured

 * What query would we use in the Mongo shell to return 
 * all movies in the video.movieDetails collection 
 * that either won or were nominated for a best picture Oscar? 
 * You may assume that an award will 
 * appear in the oscars array only 
 * if the movie won or was nominated. 
 * You will probably want to create a little sample data 
 * for yourself in order to work this problem.
