Let's suppose you have a five member replica set and want to assure that writes are committed to the journal __(j=1)__
and are acknowledged by at least 3 __(3/5 = majority)__ nodes before you proceed forward. 
What would be the appropriate settings for w and j?

* ~~w=1, j=1~~
* ~~w="majority", j=1~~
* ~~w=3, j=0~~
* ~~w=5, j=1~~
* ~~w=1, j=3~~
